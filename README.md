Hi, my name is Haya.
I am a Computer Science student at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University. I enjoy learning about programming and exploring how computer science concepts are used in real applications.
In my free time, I like to practice my skills, learn new technologies, and work on small projects. I am interested in Machine Learning and how it can be used to solve real-world problems.
